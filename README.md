## **-->> 📌 Key Steps Performed In EDA Analysis**

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Removing duplicates & irrelevant fields  
   - Data type conversions & formatting  

2. **Univariate Analysis**  
   - Distribution of vehicle types, regions, and usage types  
   - Battery capacity, charging time, and resale value distribution  

3. **Bivariate Analysis**  
   - Battery capacity vs Range correlation  
   - Usage type vs Monthly charging cost comparison  
   - Vehicle type vs Charging time  

4. **Multivariate Analysis**  
   - Correlation heatmap for EV performance features  
   - Range vs Mileage with vehicle type trends  
   - Cost analysis across usage type & vehicle type  

5. **Insights & Conclusions**  
   - Identified EV adoption trends by region  
   - Highlighted performance trade-offs (range, charging time, battery health)  
   - Compared running & maintenance costs across usage types

## **-->> 📌 Recommendations / Insights**

1. **Battery & Range**  
   - Higher battery capacity strongly improves range (~0.94 correlation).  
   - Manufacturers should balance **battery cost vs efficiency** for optimal adoption.  

2. **Usage Trends**  
   - **Personal usage dominates**, but commercial & fleet adoption is growing.  
   - Policies & incentives can encourage commercial EV adoption.  

3. **Cost Factors**  
   - **Maintenance cost > Insurance cost** for most EVs.  
   - Fleet vehicles show higher long-term costs → scope for optimization.  

4. **Regional Performance**  
   - **Australia & North America** lead in resale value and adoption.  
   - **Asia** shows higher hatchback adoption → reflects affordability trends.  

5. **Sustainability Impact**  
   - **CO₂ savings increase with mileage**, proving EVs’ long-term environmental benefits.  
   - Promoting **high-mileage EV adoption** can maximize sustainability impact.
